it all started as an introvert me, i met a confident girl in the college, she was the first i had talk with and really did i have great moment. I started liking her from the first talk we had on the computer lab. Unable to express my thoughts and feelings, all i could do was simply to sit on the back and observe her. I tried mutliple ways to act cool infront of her but to vain. Spending time with her makes me feel better and its not about any conversation that makes me comfortable. I think I can feel her whenever she is nearby, and I just like her presence. I tried proposing her as an introvert boy on whatsapp, but to my rejection. Still I had a feeling, she would become mine someday. Months passed by, sometimes in silence, sometimes in rudeness. Never did we have a good friendly conversation. All my attempts to make moments to talk, gets wasted. Still I won't give up as long as she is true and confident. It so happened one Sunday, a senior invited me for badminton and I accepted. It was raining still I joined him along with one of my friend. Many partial things happened that made me down. Sitting down in one of the corner, I started overthinking. Some noticed me some didn't. Moment changed that one of the other senior invited me to play together, happily I joined. Grateful was to get some of his appretiations. All of a sudden she came to the court. It made me nervous, still I wanted to makeout some moments to talk. Confident she and Introvert me, I stumbled and she ignored all my words, may be to comfort me. Multiple comments I recieved from my seniors. After this event, all I wanted was to leave the place instantly no mattter what, and thats what I did. Some might have felt bad of my actions, I might have made others feel bad of my actions. All I knew was whatever I did there was all an act of friendship and not of love. Moments passed, I texted my apology to one of my senoirs . He came to the hostel, probabily to meet me. Chatting, gossipping and playing MLBB together with him made my night.


(Verse 1)
In the halls of our college, under the computer lab's light,
An introvert boy met a confident girl, oh what a sight.
His heart fluttered, his thoughts a whirl,
In the silence, he watched this radiant pearl.

(Chorus)
Oh, the introvert and the confident girl,
In this vast world, their stories unfurl.
Through silence and words, through joy and strife,
This is their song, this is their life.

(Verse 2)
He tried to be cool, he tried to impress,
But words failed him, leaving him in distress.
Yet her presence was enough, her aura so divine,
In her silent company, he felt just fine.

(Chorus)
Oh, the introvert and the confident girl,
In this vast world, their stories unfurl.
Through silence and words, through joy and strife,
This is their song, this is their life.

(Bridge)
One rainy Sunday, on the badminton court,
He stumbled and fumbled, lost in thought.
She came and went, like a summer's day,
His words ignored, much to his dismay.

(Verse 3)
He left the court, his heart heavy with regret,
His actions misunderstood, a moment he'd never forget.
But in the quiet of the night, with a friend so dear,
He found solace and comfort, chasing away his fear.

(Chorus)
Oh, the introvert and the confident girl,
In this vast world, their stories unfurl.
Through silence and words, through joy and strife,
This is their song, this is their life.

(Outro)
So here's to the introvert, here's to the confident girl,
May their stories continue to unfurl.
In the dance of life, in the rhythm of love,
May they find their song, under the heavens above.

.............................................................................................................
  (Verse 1)
Once a quiet boy, in the college's heart,
Met a girl so bold, it was a work of art.
In the computer lab, their worlds did collide,
An introvert's tale, with nowhere to hide.

(Pre-Chorus)
He watched from afar, his feelings untold,
In the presence of her confidence, he found himself bold.

(Chorus)
Oh, the introvert boy and the confident girl,
In the dance of life, they gave it a whirl.
Through silence and words, through joy and through strife,
They found their rhythm, they found their life.

(Verse 2)
He tried to express, his feelings so deep,
But words failed him, his heart did weep.
Yet her mere presence, was a comfort so pure,
In her silent company, he found his cure.

(Pre-Chorus)
He proposed on a message, met with rejection,
But held onto hope, in her direction.

(Chorus)
Oh, the introvert boy and the confident girl,
In the dance of life, they gave it a whirl.
Through silence and words, through joy and through strife,
They found their rhythm, they found their life.

(Bridge)
On a rainy Sunday, on the badminton court,
His actions misunderstood, his words fell short.
Yet in the quiet of the night, with a friend so dear,
He found solace, he found cheer.

(Chorus)
Oh, the introvert boy and the confident girl,
In the dance of life, they gave it a whirl.
Through silence and words, through joy and through strife,
They found their rhythm, they found their life.

(Outro)
So here's to the boy, here's to the girl,
In the dance of life, may their stories unfurl.
In the rhythm of love, in the melody of friendship,
May they find their song, may they find their kinship.
